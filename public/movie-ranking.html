        <h1>The Best Movies According to Darren</h1>
        <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

        <hr />

        <h3>Brave Heart</h3>
        <p>Gripping performance by Mel Gibson. Fight against Tyranny and commitment.</p>
        <h3>Gladiator</h3>
        <p>Maximus' speech in response to Commodus calling him "slave" in the Colosseum, same effect 2 decades later. <i>Goosebumps....</i> Score by Enya punctuates the sentiments.</p>
        <h3>LOTR Trilogy (maybe the Matrix :-) </h3>
        <p>Visual effects and script. Smeagol epic.</p>
